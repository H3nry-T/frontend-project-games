<h1>Frontend project nc_games(board games website)</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This is my frontend project using React.js. This application is supposed to emulate a real-world service such as trust-pilot. It is a website that shows a list of reviews on board games. The entire project was a culmination of 10 weeks of javascript starting off in November. The data used is hosted using "ElephantSQL" and the backend is hosted using "render".</p> 
<p>The backend project is in my github: <a href="https://github.com/H3nry-T/backend-project-nc-games.git">https://github.com/H3nry-T/backend-project-nc-games.git</a></p>

<h2>Hosted on:</h2><a href="https://board-games-website.netlify.app">https://board-games-website.netlify.app</a>

<i>REST API hosted using render free tier. Please be patient when waiting for the app to start</i>
